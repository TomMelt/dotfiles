Dot Files
=========
This repo contains my collection of shamelessly stolen dot files and config options. Feel free to borrow ideas or the whole thing. Please be aware these are highly personalized - especially my vim config.

dot files for:
- vim
- tmux
- ctags
- git
- gnuplot

The most extensive are those for vim

Installation
============

    git clone git@github.com:TomMelt/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles

Currently I stongly advise against using my install script. Is it built solely for my purposes and it is neither clear nor general.

    ./install.sh

To Do
=====
- install script is too basic
- needs updating to be more general
